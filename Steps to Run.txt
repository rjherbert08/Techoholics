-A full-stack tech blog website in Python and Django with functionalities of multi-users and authorizations, user posts, user comments
Developed the front-end and back-end using Djangoâ€™s Model-View-Template design pattern
Framework: HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap4, JavaScript, Python, Django

The user can create posts, edit/update them and delete them. The user also has a choice to either pulish 
their posts or keep them as drafts which can then later be published. The user can also post comments on 
each other's posts and have functionality to either approve or not approve comments. This project is made 
almost according to the internship task as described(some features may differ).

The blog has user registration functionality and latest posts are displayed. This is just like blog/social
 media site we use in daily life.
